1. Be as precise as possible.  Don't say "Ensure that you see the correct value"; say exactly what value you expect to see.

2. Remember to put down all the necessary steps and preconditions!

3. The "Test Case" label is for a description of the test case in plain English.  For example, "Ensure that user can go North from the starting room."

4. You do not need to exhaustively test the application!  If you find yourself with more than three or four test cases per requirement, you may be over-testing.  This is admirable in software where human life is at stake, but this is only your grade.

5. This is a test plan, not a test run - remember the difference.  If you do not know, read the book!

6. Remember that tests should be reproducible - starting with all preconditions met, anybody should be able to reproduce the same steps and get the same results.  If they can't, rethink your preconditions!

* If you like, you may purchase a physical copy on Amazon at: http://www.amazon.com/Friendly-Introduction-Software-Testing/dp/1523477377/ or CreateSpace at: https://www.createspace.com/6008739 .  It is $14.95 at either.
  * However, this is NOT NECESSARY.  All material is available online, either in this repository or in the (freely available) PDF version of the book linked above.  Some people prefer to have a physical copy and I have made this book as affordable as I can for those who prefer that.

**Recommended Texts:** 

Test-Driven Development: By Example, Kent Beck ISBN-13: 978-0321146533

Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach, Paul Jorgensen, ISBN-13: 978-1466560680

I have both of these texts available for you to borrow.

This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern
software testing and quality assurance. Although it will cover testing
theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software
testing currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover: manual
and automated tests, test-driven and behavior-driven development,
performance testing, and understanding and developing a testing
process.

## Grading

* Mid-term Exam 1 - 15%
* Mid-term Exam 2 - 15%
* Projects:
  * Deliverable 1 - 10%
  * Deliverable 2 - 10%
  * Deliverable 3 - 10%
  * Deliverable 4 - 10%
  * Deliverable 5 - 10%
  * Final Deliverable - 10%
* Class Participation - 10%

Although you are not required to come to every class, it is strongly recommended that you do.  Attendance _will_ be taken for days with guest lecturers or class exercises, and this will count for your class participation.

The following grading scale will be used.  

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-94.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93.99-91.00  | A-
90.99-88.00  | B+
87.99-84.00  | B
83.99-81.00  | B-
80.99-78.00  | C+
77.99-74.00  | C
73.99-71.00  | C-
70.99-68.00  | D+
67.99-64.00  | D
63.99-61.00  | D-
60.99-0.00   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group projects, and students to do entirely their own work on the other projects.  Projects will be analyzed with the Stanford _moss_ system to detect unauthorized collaboration between groups or individuals.

Any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

Assignments should be committed and pushed to GitHub or GitLab to _a private repository_ and shared with the TA and me by the beginning of class on the due date.  Write-ups are due at the beginning of class and must be given to me in person.  Late assignments will not be accepted absent of extraordinary circumstances.

If any disputes from groups arise, I will assume that GitHub is the "ground 
truth".  For example, if Partner A insists that they did all the work, but GitHub history shows only commits by Partner B, I will assume that Partner B has done all the work.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final
grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies
in grading.

## Attendance

Lecture attendance for non-exercise and non-visiting-lecturer classes is not required, but is STRONGLY recommended. The instructor will try to ensure that all information on the exams and projects will be available via slides, but simply reading them may be insufficient to understand the concepts thoroughly.   Presence for exercise days is required in order to get the full
class participation score.  These will not be rescheduled individually.

Presence for the mid-term exams is REQUIRED.  They will be
individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency.  If you
are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor IMMEDIATELY (if
it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for an exam
without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0
(zero) for that exam.

## Project Details

* **Deliverable 1:** A test plan and traceability matrix for a system.
* **Deliverable 2:** Unit tests for a console-based application written by the student.
* **Deliverable 3:** Automated system-level tests for a web application.
* **Deliverable 4:** Performance testing and improvement of an application.
* **Deliverable 5:** Rewriting a system based on the results of static analysis.
* **Final Deliverable:** An analysis and test strategy for a large application of your choice.

Deliverables must be handed in by close of class on the day that it is
due.  Late deliverables will NOT be accepted.

## Programming Language Selection

For all deliverables, the class will use Java with the appropriate frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Mockito, Selenium, FindBugs, checkstyle).

If you want to use Java but aren't a fan of Eclipse, information on setting up the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) with the required packages for this course can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/alexlafroscia/c6757de349b27e34eff6).
